            <h2 class="bodyTitle">Pittsburgh Protectorate</h2>
            <p class="bodyText">
                The <a href="Protectorate.html">Protectorate</a> of Pittsburgh is of relatively small size due to its proximity to other branches, and is known to have shared officers with the Cleveland, Columbus, and Philadelphia offices.
                Its current permanent members include three full-fledged capes: Girder (leader), Shonen, and Monumental. There are three Wards: Hermes (Boogaloo) the team "leader", Shoujo, and
                Reality Check.
            </p>

            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="origin">Members</h4>
            <h4>Girder (Jack Williamson)</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                <a href="PowerClassifications.html">Breaker</a> 5, Brute 5, Shaker 1. The leader of the Pittsburgh Protectorate team, Girder is known for approachability and community work. One of the
                few capes who actually makes his identity known. Championed for the unionization and rights of capes both in and outside of the Protectorate. Jack has been known to spend his free time 
                performing concerts with his band, usually for charity functions. Jack is also known for his humane treatment of villain capes, often citing trigger events causing undue mental torment 
                and driving people to make such decisions. In one incident his family was threatened by a group of villain capes. The group was immediately onset by other villain capes and dismantled.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                Girder's powers include the ability to coat himself in metal, incredible strength and endurance, and the ability to pick up any metal as if it were weightless. Often seen engaging 
                actual battles wielding a girder.
            </p>
            <h4>Shonen</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                Brute (???), Mover 2. Shonen has a full showcase of Brute powers including increased endurance, strength, and speed. It appears that his powers are affected directly by the amount of 
                danger his friends are in, and the bond he shares with those around him. This power seems to have no upper limit. His costume rotates through anime character cosplay. 
            </p>
            <h4>Monumental</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                Master 5, Tinker 1. Monumental has the ability to sculpt out of many materials. Any of his sculptures have the ability to animate and perform actions such as fight, mundane tasks, or 
                anything that does not require incredible intelligence. It is speculated from interviews with Monumental that the more time he spends on one of his creations, the more powerful it becomes. 
            </p>
            <h4>Hermes (Boogaloo)</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                Shaker 5, Mover 2. Hermes (Boogaloo) is the leader of the Ward team of the Pittsburgh Protectorate. Boogaloo appears to have powers allowing him to control electricity to a degree, 
                as well as electromagnetism. He can use this ability to shoot projectiles or propel himself. His powers are also known for emitting fields of EMP, frying electronics up to 2 blocks 
                away in some instances.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                The Electric Boogaloo Incident: During one of Pitt University's home games, there was an incursion with the Goliaths and Boogaloo was the first responder. During the fight, not only 
                were most of the electronic devices in the area fried, there were incredible amounts of property damage, as well as many civilian casualties. During one of the EMP blasts, the PA system 
                of the stadium was damaged, causing <i>The Electric Slide</i> to play on a loop. Due to the damage to the surrounding area and the inability to reach the computer system, this continued 
                for multiple days. This greatly diminished public opinion of Boogaloo (Hermes) and lead to his new moniker.
            </p>
            <h4>Shoujo</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                Shaker 9, Blaster 6, Stranger 4. Shoujo, the youngest member of the Wards, appears to be at oldest 13. Shoujo appears to have the ability to control and manipulate light. This has been 
                used to create beams of light capable of cutting through steel, creating total darkness in an area, making herself and other objects invisible, and making herself sparkle <i>(constantly)</i>. 
                Her costume consists of a "magical girl" outfit and mask. She is often referred to as Shonen's sidekick, and is the longest standing member of the PRT's Ward team.
            </p>
            <h4>Reality Check</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                Trump 3. Reality Check has the ability to "impose reality" on areas. While it appears that he can project it to areas he is not in, the effect appears to be more powerful the closer the 
                area is to him. This seems to affect all powers other than already created Tinker tech. The effect of the power can range from dampening to complete nullification.
