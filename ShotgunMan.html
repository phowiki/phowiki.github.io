                It is believed that Shotgun Man is a <a href="PowerClassifications.html">Tinker</a> 4, Blaster 4 with a specialization in ranged munitions. FUCKING SHOTGUNS. THEY'RE SHOTGUNS. ONLY. He has been seen
                with varying specialized "Shotguns." These include such abilities as to never run out of ammo, using some kind of friction based technology, a weapon with retractable blade capable of
                cutting through steel and bulletproof vests (SHOTGUN SWORD), and it is also believed that his visor contains a HUD as he has been seen having conversations with it. These weapons are also
                strong enough to do serious damage even to lesser Brutes and punch through some capes force fields.
            </p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle">History</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2" id="history">
                The first reported incident of this man was in late 2001 in the nothern area of Syracuse. There were news reports of a series of murders of both unaligned and villainous natures. All of 
                the bodies seem to have been DEATH MURDERED with some sort of Tinker tech device. In October of 2001 the <a href="BradfordIncident.html">Bradford Incident</a> occurred, in which hero 
                capes attempted to stop Shotgun Man. FUckers. Of the 6 capes on site, there were 2 fatalities and 4 casualties.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                After this, Shotgun Man went underground for some time, presumed to be dead from injuries sustained from the incident. Until late 2002, when incidents resumed through
                the greater New York and Pennsylvania area. In 2007 the Armada Incident in Cancun, Mexico occurred, which is believed to be the work of Shotgun Man, under the moniker "El Bandito Shotguno,"
                He is believed to be the culprit because this wiki page was edited saying such 48 times in a row. Since then, he has gone on infrequent sprees, eliminating mostly villain capes along the
                way.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                In 2005 after PHOwiki.com was launched, moderators started recieving death threats after repeated edits were removed from this page. This reached a head when the website
                founders recieved one shotgun shell outside of his front door with a note saying "Cut the shit, nerd - Probably Steve" This was the moniker Shotgun Man was using at the time.

            <p class="bodyText2">
                It is believed that Shotgun Man may be a rogue element of the <a href="PRT.html">PRT</a>. This is supported by his knowledge of PRT protocol and his ability to evade capture. This is also
                supported by the appearance of his costume, which appears to be modified PRT gear. Some believe that he is still employed by the PRT and is used to eliminate threats that they cannot be
                publicly tied to. Others believe that he is a gun for hire, and is used by gangs to eliminate competition. Also, FUCK SCION. PEACE BITCHES. Hey Siri, look up garlic bread recipes.
