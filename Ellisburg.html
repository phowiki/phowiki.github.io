            <p class="bodyText">
                Small town gets a new parahuman, and shortly stops displaying any signs of life. In late January, the local police started getting reports of pets going missing from backyards. 
                The next day cell phone towers are attacked. A number of new villains appeared but the common motive behind their crimes indicated that the local authorities were dealing 
                with one <a href="PowerClassifications.html">Shiter</a>-type villain. Ellisburg is quiet, no dogs barking nor bees buzzing. Nothing escaped the town, human or otherwise. Faced with a town that had disappeared off 
                of a map The <a href="PRT.html">PRT</a> sent in mixed cape and PRT Squads to try and find the culprit, Jamie Rinke.  They were greeted by an empty town. Just like the residents they realized something too 
                late, where were all the insects. The PRT is unable to get reliable intelligence past a few initial days. The population of the town was 5,000 prior, current numbers are unknown. Since the 
                incident the entire town has been quarantined so as to contain Nilbog.

            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="origin">Nilbog</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                Nilbog is the <a href="ThreatClassification.html">S Level</a> threat that caused the Ellisburg Incursion. Jamie Rinke, known publicly as Nilbog, is a crazed lunatic who rules Ellisburg as his personal 'fiefdom'. 
                He is a dangerous individual with the potential to be an S-Class threat, along with the <a href="EndBringers.html">Endbringers</a> and the Slaughterhouse Nine.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                Nilbog is a Master 10, Trump 4. Jamie has the power to create minions that are customized with feelings and powers of their own. He does this by recycling pre-existing living material. 
                His monsters have the ability to breed and give birth to more monsters, coming in a variety of shapes and forms. This earns him an S-Class rating under the PRT Operations Manual as he 
                is a "high level duplicator ... who operate[s at an] exponential degree" with his creations having their own fantastic abilities.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                As Nilbog, he is only limited in the amount of living matter he has to manipulate and shape. He converts this living matter from a target by enclosing them in one of his generated 
                sacs. The target could fight free if able to, but otherwise once enclosed the targets biological material is converted into a 'slurry' as Nilbog transfers them through his body into 
                another sac where the slurries component parts can now be used or converted.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                He can't pull anything from thin air. He needs to be in contact with X amount of helpless biomass to produce X amount of minion stuff. If the target can move, they can fight free of 
                the enclosing sac. Once enclosed, it's a question of being transferred from one point of contact with Nilbog to another, processed as they pass through his body. The hunchback 
                and robe are basically containers for the biomass (rendered into a slurry) that he's carrying on his person, and he wears a goblin suit (basically a created goblin with a 
                Nilbog-shaped hole he can climb into) for the strength to haul it about.
            </p>
            <p class="bodyText2">
                He maintains a clairvoyant awareness of all of his creations and can rapidly distinguish between his children and any impostors. Further his creations have their own volition, 
                though they will follow their creators orders.
