                    <p class="bodyText">Aliases: Ziz, Israfel, Ulama. Gender: Genderless with Female pronouns. Age: Uknown. Classification: Thinker ~10, Tinker 3, Trump 3, Base of Operations Mobile</p>
                    <p class="bodyText"><i>"She turned to one side, and Krouse could make out her face.  Her features were delicate with high cheekbones. Her eyes were gray from corner to corner. And cold. There was nothing he could point to, no particular feature or quality that could help him explain why or how, but seeing her face made it harder to ascribe any kind of human quality to her. If he’d been thinking she had a sense of modesty before, he didn’t now."</i> - Legend</p>

            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="origin">Appearance</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">The Simurgh appears as a fifteen-foot tall woman, waif-thin and unclothed. Her hair is almost as long as she is tall and is, like the rest of her form, platinum-white. She has a variety of asymmetrically and apparently randomly placed feather wings, which appear excessively large compared to her body. Parts of her are described as being "hollow", or made from carefully placed wings, which serve as replicas of the absent body part. Her eyes are a solid gray, described by Krouse as seeming cold. She wraps her three largest wings around her, ostensibly to preserve her modesty, although Krouse doubts, after coming close to her, that she has a sense of modesty at all. </p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="abiltiesPower">Abilities and Powers</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">The Simurgh possesses a psychic 'scream' - a type of psychic echolocation that allows her to scan her surroundings while exerting psychic pressure to alter behavior, implant messages, or create compulsions. Her "hibernation" state in orbit allows her to make low-intensity scans of the planet with this sense. To victims, it is usually perceived as a scream in the back of their minds, constantly changing in pitch and tone.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">She possesses the ability of precognition, perfect awareness of the immediate future, and the more she sings/scans the further it reaches. She sees the past in a similar manner, and can focus on a single target for faster information, but is blind to the present moment. Future-viewers obscured possibilities from her sight.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">She could see things that were otherwise obscured by looking at people's perceptions of them, or otherwise observing their consequences, as well as by predicting their most likely course.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">She uses these scans to make long-term predictions of behavior and activity (in the order of months and years) to turn human beings into rube-goldberg devices, with whole streams or strings of horrific events occurring in areas she's been active. She can influence machines as well as people. Her scan allows her to borrow and copy techniques and mental powers - including <a href="PowerClassifications.html">Tinker</a> powers - and then telekinetically pull together a macro-scale version of their devices from the surrounding materials. With enough knowledge of a subject, she can evoke memories subconsciously through her posture and actions. By placing a target in a stressful environment, this can be used to cause hallucinations</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">The Simurgh is also a powerful telekinetic capable of tossing buildings and flight. She could strike a hundred targets simultaneously with thrown debris. She could create "decoys" out of debris capable of fooling <a href="Scion.html">Scion</a>. Her telekinesis was seemingly <a href="MantonEffect.html">Manton-limited</a>, but could still throw capes around by manipulating debris, cape-created material and costumes. Like all <a href="EndBringers.html">Endbringers</a>, she is immensely durable and strong.</p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="history">History</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">The Simurgh was the third Endbringer to appear, appearing just after the turn of the millennium. She first appeared in Lausanne, Switzerland in December 2002, and initially appeared benevolent and cooperative while psychically manipulating the people around her. Most residents of the Swiss capital, due to exposure to her mental manipulation, became violent and aggressive, attempting to kill as many people as they could and disrupt the world's resistance to the Endbringers as much as possible. This caused havoc throughout the country and the continent with wide ranging consequences. Lausanne's population was barricaded in and bombed. This conclusion was voted by UN by a slim majority. It was believed to save more potential life.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">She attacked London on August 12th, 2003. It is unknown what the outcome of this event was. The Simurgh was responsible for the corruption of Sphere, leading him to become the serial killer and Slaughterhouse Nine member known as Mannequin. She also attacked Madison, Wisconsin, in December 2009. Heroes won, but as in previous attacks the aftermath necessitated the quarantine of the city. While the city was not bombed immmediately, it was subsequently neutralized after reports of recently triggered capes being able to escape. The conservative estimate of these secondary casualities are in the ten's of thousands.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">The Simurgh also attacked Canberra on February 24th, 2011; the event was a Scion no-show, but a Legend/Eidolon victory. The aftermath of this attack necessitated the construction of a dome around the city. Finally leading  to a "humane" approach to those afflicted.</p>
