            <p class="bodyText">Watchdog, sometimes called WEDGDG, is a <a href="PRT.html">PRT</a> sub-group focused primarily on preventing economic and political disruption by parahumans.</p>
            <div class="contents">
                <h4>Contents</h4>

            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="origin">Modus Operandi</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">Superpowers change the world overtly and covertly. The <a href="Protectorate.html">Protectorate</a> and PRT deal with the capes who can level buildings but Watchdog deals with capes who can cause Global Depressions from a personal computer. Groups of <a href="PowerClassifications.html">Thinkers</a> cooperate to sift through large quantities of data using their individual talents, covering one another's weaknesses and expanding on their leads, to route out such malfeasance. WEDGDG (Watchdog colloquially and everywhere else in this article) covers the political sphere, the financial market, international crime, parahuman science, and the PRT itself.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Personnel are likely to be involved in covert and overt investigations, fugitive manhunts, and anti-criminal mastermind/conspiracy operations. Watchdog members commonly staff problem sites, such as the for the outtake process of the Madison quarantine zone(per D.D.I.D. law), and providing consultations for the Ellisburg quarantine zone.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">That said, Watchdog apparently does not function optimally: In 2011 Watchdog was the subject of internal testing and investigation and the results suggested embezzlement, international spying and insider trading on the part of PRT employees. Many precognitives, clairvoyants and empaths fled the group or the country around the time there were any hints of an investigation. Nevertheless they were seen as effective by the general populace.</p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="examples">Structure</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">Watchdog is based primarily in San Francisco with sub offices scattered throughout, with dedicated offices at Quarantine zones. Like it's parent organization it employs a mix of staff; the non-parahuman members are stated to be tasked with gathering information for the Thinkers to analyze. Unlike in the Protectorate, a Watchdog cape would likely work a simple nine-to-five job (adjusted for individuals needs), either performing detective work with a focus on financial, political, legal, international, and big-picture shenanigans, or work to back up the PRT and civilian law enforcement by resolving information requests by priority.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Parahumans that are part of Watchdog include Thinkers, Tinkers, and possibly Strangers.</p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="PRTresponse">PRT Response</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">As a sub organization of the PRT cooperation should be in built, but it is not always that clear. As mentioned above it is used as an ad hoc Internal Affairs branch for the PRT and Protectorate. This works both ways of course with the PRT conducting its own investigations into Watchdog's finances whenever the political will crystallizes.</p>
