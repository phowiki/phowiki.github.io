                    <p class="bodyText">Behemoth (pronounced: "bih-HEE-moth") is one of the <a href="EndBringers.html">Endbringers</a>. He is the first of the Endbringers, followed by <a href="Leviathan.html">Leviathan</a> and <a href="TheSimurgh.html">The Simurgh</a>. He's a dynakinetic, meaning he has complete control over all types of energy from radiation to kinetic. On top of this he has no <a href="MantonEffect.html">Manton Limitation</a> and is the most durable of the Endbringers. Although he is very slow and incapable of dodging attacks he can render a region uninhabitable over a course of a few hours.</p>

            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="origin">Abilities and Powers</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">Most of Behemoth's powers are simply variations of his dynamokinesis, an all encompassing manipulation of all kinds of energy. What makes this ability even more dangerous is he isn't limited by the Manton Effect, meaning he can affect living matter as easily as any other material. The most common expressions of this are: </p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Lightning: One of Behemoth's most iconic and feared abilities is his ability to create and guide lightning. Most likely he can generate anywhere but he typically launches it from the tips of his claws. These lightning bolts can range from an average sized lightning bolt to being able to cut one of <a href="Dragon.html">Dragon's</a> craft in half in only five hits. These particular bolts are mainly used to start fires in areas that will burn the fastest and behaves like normal lighting. However when he focuses on this ability he can blow apart Dragon-craft in one hit and produce bolts the diameter of an apartment building. Behemoth can also guide these bolts to hit pinpoint targets and clustered groups of people. They also defy the normal laws of conduction and can arc out of metal objects when normally they'd ground out.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Kill Aura: Behemoth can bypass the Manton Effect and manifest energy within anyone who ventures within 32 feet of him, burning them from the inside out. The recommended distance is over 100 feet so there's no risk of him closing the gap before one can get away. This ability makes anyone without extreme durability or ranged attacks nearly worthless in the fight.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Radiation: Another signature ability of Behemoth's is to project radiation around himself. When he does this, he glows with white light.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Roar: By using his manipulation of sonics and kinetic energy whenever he roars he can cause massive damage to an area or groups of people. Within seconds of being hit by it eardrums and eyes alike will often explode from the sheer force. If a person is not immediately brought to safety their internal organs will quickly liquefy. It can even be powerful enough at times to shatter forcefields and knock over buildings.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Shock-Waves: One of Behemoths ranged attacks is the ability to produce powerful shock-waves. He typically generates these by clapping his hands or claws together. They are powerful enough to knock over buildings and often come in quick succession. These also have a double purpose of being used to spread the radiation he produces over a further area.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Heat Generation: One of his more basic abilities is to simply generate massive amounts of heat. Besides simply cooking opponents to death he can use it to superheat to temperatures capable of destroying airborne drones, guiding fires to vulnerable spots, and melting debris into balls of magma (which he can then throw).</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Energy Redirection: One of his few defensive abilities besides simply tanking any shots thrown at him is to redirect the energy from the attack. With this he can move the energy from an attack into the ground around him or even use it to strengthen his own attacks. Notable uses include deflecting away all of Alexandria's punches and even channeling her attack's energy into his fist to smack her out of the air. However he can only do this when he knows an attack is coming.</p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="history">History</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">Behemoth has attacked the most times out of any any Endbringer since he was the first. Almost all of his attacks result in massive casualties, earning him the name Herokiller. The average rate of death for heroes fighting him is, probably, more than one in four. This is mostly due to his sheer durability and attacks that easily kill non-invincible heroes.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">On December 13th, 1992 Behemoth, or Hadhayosh as he was called, appeared for the first time to attack Marun, Iran's second largest oil field. However he appeared miles away from it rather than simply coming up directly underneath it. The <a href="Protectorate.html">Triumvirate</a> present at the time were caught off guard since their purpose for being there was only "earthquake relief." Several of the local heroes died almost immediately but the Triumvirate managed to put up a fight. The oil field was completely obliterated causing a massive hike in fuel cost and a major petruleom crisis. This lead to implementtion of new tinker tech to replace old oil resources. It was also rumored that Eidolon was wounded in the fight. These reports have never been comfirmed.</p>
