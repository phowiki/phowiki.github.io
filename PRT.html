            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="origin">Modus Operandi</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">The PRT is primarily a PR organization. They try to shape the public perception of capes in media, giving <a href="Protectorate.html">Protectorate</a> capes tips at interviewing, or making sure movies show positive examples of parahumans and heroes being invincible and heroic.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">The PRT emblem is shaped like a shield and bears the letters ‘P.R.T.' It was often depicted with wings.</p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="abilitiesPower">Structure</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">The PRT is a multinational organization spanning the United States of America and Canada, with talks about expanding into Mexico. It is overseen as a whole by the Chief Director and Deputy Chief Director while Directors and Deputy Directors oversee individual PRT departments. Local Parahuman Response Team Directors usually have a say in the decisions that the Protectorate make as well as the equipment, locations, and funds available to them. Each Department has varying responsibilities and jurisdiction based on their placement.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">United States' PRT departments are designated from one to sixty-seven in order of the country's largest cities to its smaller ones, with smaller offices located in other cities and towns. Canadian cities were added later as part of a treaty, but given special designations (Vancouver (NW), Edmonton (N), Toronto (NE), etc.).</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Brockton Bay (ENE), Pueblo (F), and Jasper (J) warranted special attention and, as such, were given special designations. Other special cases included quarantine zones (PRT departments Q1 through Q7) which are, in order: Gary, Indiana (unexplained explosion in villain population); Freedom, California (Pastor); Eagleton, Tennessee (Machine Army); Ellisburg, New York State (Nilbog); Flint, Michigan (Redacted); Gallup, New Mexico (Villain Group); and Madison, Wisconsin (<a href="TheSimurgh.html">Simurgh</a>).</p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="subOrgs">Sub Organizations</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2"><a href="WEDGDG.html">WEDGDG</a></p>
            <p class="bodyText2"><a href="MIRIS.html">MIRIS</a></p>
            <p class="bodyText2"><a href="Protectorate.html">The Protectorate</a></p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="consequences">Equipment</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">PRT officers wear chain mesh and kevlar vests, and helmets that cover their faces.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">They carry firearms - both pistols and assault rifles. These are usually loaded with nonlethal rounds, unless targeting individuals who are considered expendible or capable of surviving. In addition, specific individuals can carry a variety of specialized equipment. The PRT officers can carry grenade launchers that carry specialized load outs, including containment foam and <a href="PowerClassifications.html">tinker</a>-made rounds.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Containment foam is the PRT's most common non-lethal response to threats. PRT officers are usually equipped with tinker-made containment foam applicators, mounted on the backs of the officer and dispensed on the target with spray applicators. The PRT, in response to large threats, has large vans with turrets mounted on the top to spray the containment foam.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">The PRT typically uses large vans for transportation, these are usually marked with purple stripes diagonally across the side,[16] the initialization of the organization stenciled on the side, their emergency lights are green and white. This distinguishes them from lights used by emergency services. It is unknown how much variation there is between individual departments.</p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="history">History</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">On January 18th, 1993 Alexandria, Eidolon, Hero and Legend were sworn in by the President of the United States under PRTCJ as the founding members of the United States' Protectorate. It was the first in a long series of steps, hastened by outside influence, that led to the formation of the PRT, the Protectorate, and in the organization of heroes worldwide. In exchange for government funding and legitimacy, the members agreed to follow a special set of laws laid out for capes, to accept bureaucratic oversight and cooperate with local authorities.</p>
