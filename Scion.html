                    <p class="bodyText">Scion was considered the most powerful individual in the world. His powers were so strong that they put him "head and shoulders" above everyone else, with the exception of the <a href="EndBringers.html">Endbringers</a>.</p>

            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="origin">Abilities and Powers</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">Stilling: Scion's primary power is the power to negate any kind of wavelength using his golden light. This effect is extremely versatile; it can be used to disintegrate matter, slow or stop motion, and negate the effects of specific powers. Stilling can be fired as beams, orbs, or area bursts, used as a force field, or transmitted by touch. When used offensively, the effect lingers, continuing to eat away at the target after the initial attack</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Flight: Scion can fly at immense speeds as an application of his general golden light aura. At his fastest, he was able to fly to the other side of the world in less than a minute. He left a short golden trail in the air.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Senses: Scion can sense everything around him through unknown means. He appears to have control over the range of his senses, and can see into other universes if he chooses.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Super Strength: Scion has superhuman strength, sufficient to lift <a href="Behemoth.html">Behemoth</a> several hundred feet into the air.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Regeneration: Scion has extremely rapid regeneration, so fast that it is almost impossible to tell he was ever injured.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Partial Power Immunity: Scion is immune to certain types of powers. His actions cannot be predicted with precognition, his powers cannot be copied, and powers cannot directly interfere with his mind in any way. In addition, his multiple senses make him very difficult to blind or mislead for any period of time.</p>
            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="history">History</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">On May twentieth, 1982, Scion was seen by a boat, whose passengers started to try to talk to him. He was touched by one passenger who was dying of cancer, this cured him. Then, he turned away from the crowd and flew away. He then spent years wandering the world, observing stopping at places. Even listening sometimes. Eventually he began helping people, getting faster and faster. By the middle of the 1990s, he was traveling from crisis to crisis, flying faster than the speed of sound. He also took to wearing cloths and by 1999, had seemingly taken to wearing a white bodysuit that was kept clean.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">At one point Scion came across a burning town and began to exterminate each source of heat. He lowered himself to get a better shot at the library and came into contact with a woman reporter who asked him his name. He answered her that his name was "Scion". It is the only time Scion is known to have spoken. Additionally, Scion once reacted to a nuclear test in the same way he had been reacting to paramilitary groups in Africa and the Middle East, shooting down a test missile and destroying the launch facility. This convinced nuclear powers that Scion would intervene, effectively ending the Cold War. He took to fighting the Endbringers, and was one of the only people who could stop them.</p>
