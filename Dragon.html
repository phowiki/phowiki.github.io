            <h2 class="bodyTitle">Dragon</h2>
            <p class="bodyText">Litle is known about Dragon. It is speculated that she is the greatest <a href="PowerClassifications.html">Tinkerer</a> on the planet, although her direct specialization is unknown. Dragon has never been seen in person and very few audio clips are available. It is surmised that she is from Newfoundland, and may possibly be crippled or disfigured in some way due to the <a href="Leviathan.html">Leviathan</a> attack. Dragon refers to herself as a recluse and likes to remain personal. She works with the Guild, the <a href="Protectorate.html">Protectorate</a>, the <a href="PRT.html">PRT</a>, and the Baumann Parahuman Containment Center a.k.a. The Birdcage.</p>

            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="origin">Creations</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">Dragon has designed and created a plethora of mechanical suits of armor that serve a variety of purposes. While these suits may differ in size, general shape, tonnage, and weapon systems, they are all generally quadrupedal with a 'dragon' theme in their design and aesthetics.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Dragon also possesses smaller units and drones which she makes use of to maintain the Birdcage and other logistical needs. Some of these units are basketball sized while others are larger and function as general utility, rapid response and rescue. These units and drones are armed with tranquilizers, electric pulses, containment foam and tear gas if they are armed at all.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Other things Dragon has created include the Birdcage, the load-outs for the specialized grenade launchers used by the PRT officers, and the containment foam sprayers (both civilian use and the larger turrets mounted on her fast response suit and on PRT vans). She is also responsible for many of the computer systems that the Protectorate makes use of.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Dragon created the armbands used during <a href="EndBringers.html">Endbringer</a> fights. They had a screen capable of tracking the user's location along with the enemy's last known location; and two buttons used for calling for help and sending messages to the others wearing the armbands. Dragon created software that screened and interpreted messages before sending them out, and directed people to help those in need of assistance. The armbands also tracked the user's vitals, sending out an alert if they were injured or killed.</p>
