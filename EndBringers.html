            <h2 class="bodyTitle">Endbringers</h2>
            <p class="bodyText">The Endbringers are monstrous beings that take turns attacking locations around the globe to cause as much damage as they possibly can. Apparently unkillable, the Endbringers retreat to their respective domains to heal after they have sustained sufficient damage, only to attack again months later.</p>

            <h4 class="bodyTitle" id="origin">Known Information</h4>
            <p class="bodyText2">An Endbringer's skin is "hard as aluminum alloy, but flexible"; and its strength, toughness, and healing factor increase exponentially. 3% deeper in toward core of arms, legs, claws, tail, or .5% in toward core of head, trunk, neck, tissues are hard as steel. The tensile strength of the material roughly doubles with each layer, every 0.5% of the way towards the center of his body and every 3% of the way toward the center of their extremities.</p>
            <p class="bodyText2"><i>"The core of an Endbringer would require around five hundred and sixty novemdecillion MPA of pressure; in practice, only parahumans capable of breaking the laws of physics can seriously harm an Endbringer."</i> - Tattletale</p>
            <p class="bodyText2">Endbringers appear to be made out of some type of a crystalline material. Due to their density, Endbringers are immune to most teleporters. They count as living matter for the purposes of the <a href="MantonEffect.html">Manton Effect</a>. Endbringer cores employ space-warping that interferes with some powers. When they take damage they leak a thick ichor-like substance, suggesting a non-standard cardiac system. Their nervous system is also foreign enough to prevent body control powers from working. They regenerate quickly as well, even in the middle of a battle. The deeper layers regen.</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="unorderedListBody"><a href="Behemoth.html">Behemoth</a> - also known as "Hadhayosh" and "Prathama" — was the first Endbringer to appear, making its first appearance in the Marun Field of Iran on December 13, 1992. It has the ability to manipulate multiple forms of energy (electrical, thermal, kinetic, and etc.) while bypassing the Manton Effect. Because of this, it gained a reputation as the 'hero killer,' possessing a high body count at short range.</li>
                <li class="unorderedListBody"><a href="Leviathan.html">Leviathan</a> - also known as "Jormungand" or "Jörmungandr" — appeared in Oslo, Norway on June 9, 1996. It has macro-hydrokinesis, speed, and a water "afterimage" that follows behind it and moves as fast as Leviathan itself. It was known for causing immense environmental damage, devastating areas such as Newfoundland and Kyushu to the point of uninhabitability.</li>
                <li class="unorderedListBody"><a href="TheSimurgh.html">The Simurgh</a> - also known as "Ziz" — appeared in Lausanne, Switzerland on December 30, 2002. It has psionic abilities, precognition, and the ability to draw on <a href="PowerClassifications.html">Tinker</a> powers around it in order to build its own Tinker devices. The Simurgh is known to adjust the events in places it attacks to set up the survivors to be "walking disasters" that happen days, months, or even years after. Affected areas were quarantined to try and mitigate these effects, such as in the case of Madison, Wisconsin.</li>
