            <p class="bodyText">
                The Goliaths are a gang operating near the University of Pittsburgh. They deal mostly in illicit drugs and consist of three active capes: Malady, Pusher, and Goliath. The Goliaths
                have been linked to recent spikes in incidents near the University of Pittsburgh. All three members appear to have interconnected powers. Goliath appears to be the leader, spending
                most of his time acting as an <a href="PowerClassifications.html">Enforcer</a> with Pusher aiding on occassion. The Goliaths on several occassions fought with local members of the <a href="PRT.html">PRT</a>. On one such occassion leading to the
                <a href="PittPRT.html">Boogaloo Incident</a>, and the other leading to the injury of <a href="PittPRT.html">Shonen</a>.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Gainz - It is believed if ingested with whey protein to give Brute-like powers at the cost of temporary insanity. Otherwise it is believed to work as a borderline untraceable
                        steroid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pretty Fly - If the user is caucasian in descent, it makes them believe they can fly. To all others, it grants increased endurance, stamina, and borderline Mover-like
                        speeds. Users have reported to be unable to sleep for days.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        High Lander - If taken in a group, and there are underlying hostilities between any members of the group, causes psychosis and violent tendencies towards other members of the 
                        group. People taking the drug have also been reported, for a short duration, to have incredible endurance i.e. continuing on long after a body should have shut down. Otherwise, 
                        causes an incredibly pleasant lucid high.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Brain Blast - Causes increased cognitive functions for a time. The amount of increase and the duration are dependent on the amount taken. Afterwards, it causes an equal amount
                        of cognitive decrease. In extreme cases can lead to brain death.

                    <li>
                        Goliath - Breaker 4, Shaker 4, Brute 4. Goliath has the ability to increase the size of himself. While in this state, his Brute powers are augmented to be even more powerful. 
                        He also has the ability to diminish or shrink damage occurring to him. He appears to have a secondary ability to pull objects towards him if he focuses on them. He appears 
                        incapable of feeling pain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Malady - Not much is known, though she is presumed to be a Tinkerer. She is believed to make all drugs the Goliaths supply. Interestingly, some of the chemical compounds used 
                        in the drugs, by all chemical knowledge, should not be capable of mixing or reacting in the way that they do.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pusher - Has the ability to create small linked portals, roughly the size of a fist. Limitations of the portals are unknown. It appears that he also can shoot things between 
                        portals and launch them out. People around Pusher have also reported feelings of general fatigue, increased anxiety, and overall increased negative emotions. Pusher also 
                        appears to have the ability to become incorporeal and move through solid objects.
